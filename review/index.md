## Change review guidelines

_These guidelines are based on [Google's review guidelines](https://google.github.io/eng-practices/review/)._
_It is also heavily cited. It is very much recommended to read the original guidelines to get a full picture._

A code review is a process where someone other than the author(s) of a piece of code examines that code.

It is a crucial process that helps:
* maintaining code in a healthy state gradually improving its quality,
* sharing the knowledge among a team,
* delivering new well-tested functionality.

Therefore it must be taken seriously by both reviewers and developers and must be seen as *a tool that helps to write good code* rather than a tool that slows down your delivery. 
In the end, we have a common goal to deliver a quality product which is stable and enjoyable to work with

## Structure

There are two parts of this guide:
* [For reviewers of the code](reviewer/index.md)
* [For authors of a change](developer/index.md)
