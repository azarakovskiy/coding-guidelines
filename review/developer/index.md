## Picking the Best Reviewers 
**♥ In general, you want to find the best reviewers you can who are capable of responding to your review within a reasonable period of time.**

The best reviewer is the person who will be able to give you the most thorough and correct review for the piece of code you are writing. Sometimes this means asking different people to review different parts of the change.

If you find an ideal reviewer but they are not available, consider CC-ing them on your change.

**♥ Try to ask specific people to review, don't throw your PR on everybody. Yet CC everybody.**

## Acknowledge every single question and suggestion
Be very explicit if you have acknowledged a comment in your PR. Write what you have done following it, or at least mention that you have seen it, and what will happen.

**♥ Never leave any question or comment in your PR without an answer or acknowledgment.**

## Do not take it personally
The goal of code reviews is not to show you that you're a bad developer. You wouldn't be here in Beat if you were a bad developer. We all have different experiences and different points of view, and this is fine.

The goal of code reviews is to make our code better, to make our product more functional and stable, and to let you also improve.

**♥ Do not take reviews too personally, they are not about you.**
